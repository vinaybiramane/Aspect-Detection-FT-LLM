# Aspect Detection
Context Based Aspect

## Context-Based Aspect 

This project focuses on fine-tuning a model for Aspect using contextual information.

### Project Structure

The project contains the following key files and directories related to fine-tuning (stored locally):

- `peft-detect-aspects-checkpoint-local/`: Directory containing locally saved checkpoints for the fine-tuned model using PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques.

### Environment

- `absa_env/`: Virtual environment directory for the project. It's recommended to use this environment to ensure consistency in package versions.

### Fine-tuning Process

The fine-tuning process likely involves the following steps:

1. Data preparation: Preprocessing and formatting the ABSA dataset.
2. Model selection: Choosing a pre-trained language model as the base.
3. PEFT implementation: Applying Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques to efficiently adapt the model for ABSA tasks.
4. Training: Fine-tuning the model on the prepared dataset.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on aspect detection and sentiment classification.
6. Checkpointing: Saving the fine-tuned model states in the `peft-detect-aspects-checkpoint-local/` directory.

### Usage

To use this project:

1. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv absa_env
   source absa_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `absa_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (requirements.txt file should be created if not present).

3. Run the fine-tuning jupyter scripts to generate your own fine-tuned model.

4. Use the fine-tuned model for ABSA tasks, loading checkpoints from the `peft-detect-aspects-checkpoint-local/` directory.

### Note

This README is based on limited information from the project structure. For more detailed instructions on running the fine-tuning process or using the fine-tuned model, please refer to specific script files or additional documentation in the project.
